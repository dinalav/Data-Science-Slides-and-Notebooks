Creating a virtual environment with Anaconda and adding it to Jupyter

    virtualenv (recomended for installing econml packages) Virtual environments help to avoid possible conflicts between different packages. For example Econml uses numpy 1.20 or below, while you might have already a later version. 
        https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/
        https://janakiev.com/blog/jupyter-virtual-envs/ This article gives good instructions how to create a virtual environment with Anaconda and how to add it in your Jupyter notebook

    econml package
        https://pypi.org/project/econml/

Steps 
    1. Open Anaconda prompt

    2. conda create -n myenv 
	where myenv is any name you want to set for your new virtual environment (e.g. conda create -n econml)
	a new environment is stored in the envs folder in your Anaconda directory.

    3. To start working in it: conda activate myenv

    4. After activating the virtual environment, you need to add its Kernel to Jupyter. 
	Install ipykernel which provides the IPython kernel for Jupyter: pip install --user ipykernel
    	Add the environment to Jupyter: python -m ipykernel install --user --name=myenv
    		You should see the following output "Installed kernelspec myenv in /home/user/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/myenv" 
		!!If such message does not appear, check in Anaconda Navigator whether Jupyter notebook is installed in this new virtual environment. If it is not the case, press 'Install' in Navigator or type 'conda install -c conda-forge notebook' in Prompt
    		Now you are able to choose this new environment as a kernel in Jupyter
        	In an open notebook: Kernel --> Change Kernel --> myenv
    5. Again from Anaconda prompt (make sure you are in the newly created virtual environment): pip install econml
    6. Open a new Jupyter notebook. Select the necessary Kernel (Kernel --> Change Kernel --> myenv). 
       Test if you have all the necessary packages installed. If some packages are missing in your new virtual environment: pip install package_name

# Packages to import 
from econml.dml import ForestDML
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor, RandomForestClassifier

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

import statsmodels.api as sm

      7. More actions in Anaconda Prompt:  
	    to stop this virtual enviroment in Anaconda Prompt: conda deactivate 
    	    to list all available environments: conda env list
    	    to remove an environment: conda env remove -n myenv
		once you remove the virtual environment, you can remove the kernel from Jupyter: jupyter kernelspec uninstall myenv
